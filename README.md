# Album Art Wallpaper

This is a system tray app for windows that will change your desktop wallpaper based on the track you are listening to.
Works with Spotify or Last.fm.

As the artwork provided is only 640px if you are using a higher resolution than 1080p the artwork will be smaller. However there is an option to resize the image in the settings.
An internet connection is required.
