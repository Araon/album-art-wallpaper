# Album Art Wallpaper

This is a system tray app for windows that will change your desktop wallpaper based on the track you are listening to on Spotify.


As the artwork provided is only 640px if you are using a higher resolution than 1080p the artwork will be smaller. However there is an option to resize the image in the settings.
An internet connection is required.

## Getting Started

[Download exe](https://github.com/jac0b-w/album-art-wallpaper/releases/latest)

[Download source](https://github.com/jac0b-w/album-art-wallpaper/archive/master.zip)

There is a short initial setup:

1. Set service in config.ini to either spotify or last.fm
2. Add the API keys for the service you are using (read below)
3. Open ```album-art-wallpaper.exe```, if you are using spotify a webpage will pop up where you can authorise your Spotify account
4. Start playing music and your desktop wallpaper will change, you can right click the app in the system tray for options.

If you are running the source you will also need to:

- Install the dependencies ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
